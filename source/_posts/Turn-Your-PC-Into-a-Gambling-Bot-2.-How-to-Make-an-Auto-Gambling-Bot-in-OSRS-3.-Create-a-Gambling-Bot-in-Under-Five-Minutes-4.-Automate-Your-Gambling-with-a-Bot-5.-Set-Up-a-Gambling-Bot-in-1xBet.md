Turn Your PC Into a Gambling Bot

For some people, gambling can become an addiction. For others, it is simply a fun hobby that they enjoy from time to time. No matter which category you fall into, if you want to take your gambling game to the next level, there is no better way than to use a gambling bot. 

A gambling bot is a computer program that is designed to automatically make bets for you. This can be an extremely helpful tool for those who want to make money while gambling but don’t have the time to do it manually. In this article, we will show you how to set up your own gambling bot in four easy steps. 

How to Make an Auto-Gambling Bot in OSRS

The first thing you will need to do is download and install the free software known asAutoHotkey. This software will allow you to write simple scripts that can automate just about any task on your PC. Once you have installed AutoHotkey, open it up and you should see a small white blank window like this: 

Now click inside the white window and type the following text: 

 !g:: RunNotepad "C:\Program Files (x86)\1xBet\localsettings.xml" 




This script will tell your computer to open up 1xBet’s localsettings.xml file every time you hit the “g” key on your keyboard. This file contains all of your account information for 1xBet, so it is important that you protect it by locking it down with a password. Now save this script somewhere on your computer (we recommend putting it in your Documents folder) and name it “GamblingBot.ahk”. 

Next, we need to create a shortcut for our script so that we can easily run it whenever we want. To do this, right-click on your Desktop and select New > Shortcut: 

 



In the box that pops up, paste in the location of your GamblingBot script file and then give it a name (we recommend calling it “Gambling Bot”). Click Next and then Finish, and you’re done! You now have a shortcut on your desktop that will automatically launch your GamblingBot every time you press it. 
Now that we have our GamblingBot set up, let’s take a look at how to use it. The first thing you will need to do is open up 1xBet and log in with your account information. Once you are logged in, click on the Menu button in the top-left corner of the screen and select Settings: 

 



From here, select the General tab and then scroll down until you see the section labelled “Scripts”: 

Here you will see all of the scripts that are currently running on your account – as well as a handy button labelled “Add new script…”. Click this button and then select your GamblingBot script file from wherever you saved it earlier (again, we recommend putting it in your Documents folder): 

 



Your GamblingBot should now be running! The first thing you will want to do is configure all of its settings according to your own personal preferences. To do this, right-click on the GamblingBot icon in your System Tray (next to the clock) and select Settings: 

 Here you can configure things such as how long the bot should stay active for, what stakes it should bet at, how much money it should start with etc.: 

 Once everything is set up according to your liking, just leave the GamblingBot running in the background while you go about other tasks – or better yet, put it on autopilot so that it can make money for you while you sleep!
