# Who is Milosz?

A poet, philosopher and mathematician, Milosz was born in 1911 in Lithuania. He wrote his first poem at the age of 7 and went on to become one of the most celebrated writers of the 20th century.

Milosz's poetry reflects his deep concern for the human condition, often exploring the dark side of human nature. His work is characterized by its metaphysical and religious themes, as well as its extraordinary beauty and poetic power.

In 1973, Milosz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "for writings which pay homage to the courage and endurance of man confronted by life's brutality and ambiguities." In his Nobel Prize speech, Milosz spoke about the need for understanding and tolerance in a world threatened by nuclear war:

"The works of Witold Gombrowicz and Czeslaw Milosz are an attempt to answer this question. They tell us that if we want to understand each other we must come to grips with our own oddity, that never-ending source of anguish and laughter. In order to do this we must first rediscover our 'own' world, which lies dormant within us like a thicket of brambles; only then can we presume to enter into communication with others."

After moving to Paris in 1939, Milosz spent much of World War II working for the Polish government-in-exile. He eventually moved to the United States, where he taught at many universities before retiring in 1987. Milosz died in 2004 at the age of 92.
