There are many different symptoms of PG, but some of the most common ones include chasing losses, preoccupation with gambling, lying about gambling behavior, and borrowings or stealing to finance gambling. Pathological gamblers also often suffer from depression, anxiety disorders, and other addictions.

Despite the risks, however, pathological gambling is a very treatable condition. There are a number of different treatments available that can help people overcome their addiction and rebuild their lives. With the help of treatment, many people are able to recover from PG and lead happy and healthy lives.
