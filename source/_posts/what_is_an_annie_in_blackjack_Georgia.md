# What is an "Annie" in Blackjack?

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played all over the world. One of the many terms used in the game is "Annie". This term is not used in all casinos or regions, but it is used in some parts of Georgia. In this article, we will discuss what an "Annie" is in blackjack and how it affects the game.

## Definition of Annie

In Georgia, an "Annie" refers to a specific rule in blackjack. It is a variation of the game that adds a new betting option for the player. In this variation, players can bet on whether the dealer will bust or not.

If a player bets on the dealer busting and the dealer does, the player wins the bet. If the dealer does not bust, the player loses the bet. The payout for this bet varies depending on the casino and the specific game rules. In some cases, it may be 1:1, while in others, it may be higher.

## How Annie Affects the Game

The addition of the Annie rule in blackjack changes the dynamics of the game. It introduces a new betting option for the player, which can increase the excitement of the game. However, it also increases the house edge, making it more difficult for players to win in the long run.

The Annie bet is considered a sucker bet by many experienced blackjack players. This is because the odds of the dealer busting are not in the player's favor. In most cases, the dealer will not bust, making it a losing bet in the long run.

Experienced blackjack players usually avoid the Annie bet and stick to the basic strategy of the game. This strategy involves making decisions based on the dealer's upcard and the player's hand. It is a proven strategy that can increase the player's chances of winning in the long run.
