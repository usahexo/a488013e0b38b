#  Casino's free slot play to be located in downtown Chicago area!

According to recent reports, the city of Chicago is in talks with two casino companies regarding the possibility of having a casino set up shop in the downtown area. The rise in gambling opportunities in the state of Illinois has officials looking for ways to capitalize on the trend, and it seems that a downtown casino may be the way to do it.

One of the companies vying for the chance to build a casino in Chicago is Rush Street Gaming, which already has a presence in the state with casinos in Aurora and Des Plaines. The other company is MGM Resorts International, which already operates casinos in Springfield and Joliet.

Officials are still hammering out all of the details, but one thing that is for sure is that any new casino would offer free slot play as an incentive for people to visit. It's hoped that this will help attract tourists to the city and also help keep money flowing into local businesses.
