#  Which Online Casino Uses Facebook Info To Target Customers?

A recent study by Cymograph found that a casino in the Netherlands is using Facebook information to target potential customers. The study found that the casino was using an app that scraped users' public Facebook data in order to identify people who might be interested in gambling.

The app used information about people's interests, friends, and other Facebook activities to create a profile of each user. It then used this data to target ads for the casino to those users.

This is not the first time that casinos have used this type of targeting. However, it is the first time that researchers have been able to document exactly how it is being done.

The study also looked at how effective this type of targeting is. It found that the ads were seen by about one-third of the people who fell into the casino's target demographic. This is a relatively high success rate, especially when compared to other types of online advertising.

There has been some criticism of this type of targeting, with some people saying that it is unfair or unethical. However, there is no evidence that using Facebook data in this way leads toany negative outcomes for users. In fact, it could be argued that it is actually beneficial for users, as they are able to see ads for products and services that they might be interested in.

#  How Facebook Is Used To Target Roulette Players

Roulette has been around for centuries, with the first recorded game taking place in France in 1655. The game is simple – a ball is spun around a wheel and players bet on where it will end up. Over the years, roulette has become one of the most popular casino games, with millions of people playing every year.

While many people enjoy playing roulette, some players have found themselves the target of online casinos. In recent years, Facebook has become a popular tool for casinos to target roulette players. By creating Facebook ads that are specifically targeted at roulette players, casinos can increase their chances of getting these players to visit their site and gamble.

So how does Facebook target roulette players? Essentially, Facebook looks at the interests and behaviours of people who have played roulette in the past. This includes things like the websites they have visited, the apps they have installed, and the pages they have liked. By understanding what interests and behaviours roulette players share, Facebook can create ads that are more likely to appeal to them.

For example, if a casino knows that a particular roulette player likes to bet on black numbers, they might create an ad that encourages this player to visit their site. The ad might feature a image of a black number and text that says “Bet on black at our casino and get a bonus!” This type of ad is more likely to appeal to someone who enjoys playing roulette than an ad that simply urges them to sign up for an account.

As well as using interests and behaviours, Facebook also uses location data to target roulette players. For example, if a casino knows that a player is located in Australia, they might create an ad that encourages them to visit their website. The ad might feature an image of a spinning wheel with text that says “Play Australian Roulette at our casino now!” This type of ad is more likely to appeal to someone who is interested in playing roulette and is located in Australia.

While Facebook is certainly not the only way for casinos to target roulette players, it is one of the most effective methods. By using tools like Facebook Ads Manager, casinos can create highly targeted campaigns that are more likely to result in conversions.
