#  NY Getting Celtic FC Sports Betting Could Boost State Economy 

According to a report by the National Hockey League (NHL) released in December, if New York State legalizes sports betting, it could result in an increase of nearly $200 million in annual gaming revenue.

The NHL report estimates that legalized sports betting could bring in between $248 million and $431 million in annual gaming revenue for New York State. The league commissioned the report as part of its ongoing efforts to gain a share of the estimated $150 billion that is illegally wagered on sports in the United States each year.

Legalizing sports betting has been a contentious issue in New York State, with lawmakers divided over how to best regulate and tax the activity. In October, Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a plan that would allow up to seven commercial casinos and one tribal casino to offer sports betting. The proposal would also allow wagers on college and professional games across the state, with the state taking a cut of the action.

However, lawmakers have been slow to act on Cuomo’s proposal, with some concerned about the impact on local businesses and A-list sporting events like the Super Bowl, which is currently exempt from legalized sports betting in New York.

If New York does move ahead with legalization, it would join a growing number of states where sports betting is legal or regulated. According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), there are now 33 states with some form of legalized sports betting.

While exact figures are difficult to come by, it is estimated that more than $4 billion was wagered on last year’s Super Bowl alone, with much of that action taken illegally. In addition to boosting state coffers through taxation, legalizing sports betting could provide a much-needed boost to local businesses and create new jobs in the gaming industry.

#  New York Officials Considering Legalizing Celtic FC Sports Betting 

This week, New York officials are considering the legalization of sports betting for Celtic FC matches. The move would bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state and could create new jobs in the gaming industry.

"This is a major decision that will have a significant impact on our state," said Governor Andrew Cuomo. "We need to carefully consider all the implications and make sure that any changes to our gambling laws are fair and benefit taxpayers."

The legalization of Celtic FC sports betting would give New York residents the opportunity to wager on matches from the Scottish Premiership and other leagues around the world. It would also allow casinos and other gaming establishments to offer bets on sports games.

Supporters of the measure say it would generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates. Governor Cuomo has not yet said which side he favors, but he is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks.

If legalized, Celtic FC sports betting could provide a major boost to New York's economy. In addition to generating tax revenue, it would create jobs in the gaming industry and bring in tourists who are interested in placing bets on their favorite team.

So far, several states have legalized sports betting in response to last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned a federal ban on the practice. It is unclear whether New York will be one of them, but lawmakers are certainly considering it as an option.

#  Why NY Didn't legalize Celtic FC sports betting until now

As of October, 2018, the New York legislature passed a bill legalizing sports betting in the state. The law allows for both in-person and online wagering on professional and college sports. While there had been speculation that the New York legislature might legalize sports betting this year, the passage of the bill came as a surprise to many.

One potential reason for the delay in legalizing sports betting may have been due to lobbying by NFL and other professional sports leagues. The leagues argue that gambling on their games could increase the chances of match fixing, and they want a piece of the sports betting revenue pie. However, it is unclear how much money the leagues would actually receive from legalized sports betting, as opposed to illegal bookmaking.

An additional reason for New York's delay in legalizing sports betting may be its large tribal gambling industry. Indian casinos have been operating in New York for many years, and they may have lobbied against legalization of mainstream sports betting.

However, despite the NFL's lobbying efforts and the presence of Indian casinos, lawmakers in New York passed the sports betting bill anyway. This may be due to the growing popularity of fantasy football and other forms of sports gambling in recent years. In addition, there is potential for significant tax revenue from legalized sports betting, which could help offset budget deficits in New York.

It will be interesting to see how quickly New York implements its new sports betting law and what sorts of regulations are put into place. It is also unclear whether other states will follow New York's lead or whether the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of nationwide legalized sports betting this year.
