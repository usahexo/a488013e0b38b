<p>The Cardinals have been led by strong performances from their batters and pitchers alike. slugger Matt Carpenter has continued his torrid pace at the plate, while pitchers Miles Mikolas and Jack Flaherty have each notched 6 wins on the year.</p>
<p>In spite of the Cardinals’ success, they remain underdogs in the eyes of many baseball fans. This is due in part to their relatively weak schedule, which has seen them face off against several subpar teams. The Cardinals will soon face tougher competition as they enter into the second half of the season.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Cardinals can maintain their hold on first place will depend on how they fare against tougher opponents. If they can continue to play well, they may very well be playing in October for the third consecutive year.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-Score-13-Runs-in-Rout-of-Padres"><a href="#Cardinals-Score-13-Runs-in-Rout-of-Padres" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Score 13 Runs in Rout of Padres"></a>Cardinals Score 13 Runs in Rout of Padres</h1><p>The Cardinals cruised past the Padres on Sunday, scoring 13 runs on 15 hits. Dexter Fowler and Harrison Bader each homered, while Yadier Molina, Kolten Wong, and Jose Martinez all collected multiple hits.</p>
<p>The Cardinals got off to a quick start, scoring four runs in the first inning. Wong got things started with a leadoff single, and Martinez drove him in with a two-run homer. Fowler then added a solo homer to make it 3-0. The Padres got one back in the bottom of the inning, but the Cardinals answered with two more runs in the second. Wong drove in one with a single, and Molina hit a sacrifice fly to make it 5-1.</p>
<p>The Padres cut the deficit to 5-3 in the fourth inning, but the Cardinals pulled away for good with eight runs in the fifth. Bader led off with a solo homer, and Wong and Martinez both added two-run singles. Matt Carpenter then hit a three-run homer to make it 13-3. The Padres added two more runs in the bottom of the inning but it was too little too late.</p>
<p>It was an impressive offensive outburst from the Cardinals, who had been struggling offensively in recent weeks. The win snapped a three-game losing streak and improves their record to 34-37 on the season.</p>
<h1 id="Wong-Hits-for-Cycle-as-Cardinals-Beat-Mets-13-4"><a href="#Wong-Hits-for-Cycle-as-Cardinals-Beat-Mets-13-4" class="headerlink" title="Wong Hits for Cycle as Cardinals Beat Mets 13-4"></a>Wong Hits for Cycle as Cardinals Beat Mets 13-4</h1><p>ST. LOUIS, MO - Rookie outfielder Tyler Wong hit for the cycle as the St. Louis Cardinals crushed the New York Mets 13-4 on Thursday afternoon at Busch Stadium.</p>
<p>Wong got things started with a solo home run off Mets starter Noah Syndergaard in the bottom of the first inning. He added a two-run triple in the second, then capped off his cycle with a single in the fifth inning.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” Wong said after the game. “I was just trying to put good swings on the ball and it paid off.”</p>
<p>Cardinals starter Michael Wacha also had a big day, pitching six innings and allowing just four hits and one run while striking out eight.</p>
<p>“Wacha was really good today,” Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. “He had good command of his fastball and Changeup, and he made them swing and miss.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals improve to 66-51 with the win, while the Mets fall to 53-64.</p>
<h1 id="DeJong-Homers-Twice-as-Cardinals-Top-Braves-13-8"><a href="#DeJong-Homers-Twice-as-Cardinals-Top-Braves-13-8" class="headerlink" title="DeJong Homers Twice as Cardinals Top Braves 13-8"></a>DeJong Homers Twice as Cardinals Top Braves 13-8</h1><p>St. Louis Cardinals’ shortstop Paul DeJong hit two home runs Wednesday night as the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves 13-8. DeJong now has 25 homers on the season, tying him with Philadelphia Phillies’ slugger Rhys Hoskins for the National League lead.</p>
<p>The first homer of the night came in the top of the third inning, off Braves starter Anibal Sanchez. The Cardinals were leading 3-1 at the time, but Sanchez promptly gave up a three-run homer to Tyler O’Neill that put the Cardinals up 6-1.</p>
<p>DeJong added his second homer of the night in the top of the seventh inning, off relief pitcher Sam Freeman. That homer gave the Cardinals a 12-4 lead and essentially put the game out of reach for the Braves.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s victory was important for the Cardinals, who are trying to solidify their spot in playoff contention. The Cardinals are now four games ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers for first place in the National League Central Division.</p>
<p>DeJong is enjoying a breakout season in 2018, batting .297 with 25 homers and 69 RBIs. He has become one of the most feared hitters in all of baseball, and it will be interesting to see how he performs in October if (and likely when) the Cardinals make it to the postseason.</p>
<h1 id="Flaherty’s-Grand-Slam-Lifts-Cardinals-Over-Nationals-13-8"><a href="#Flaherty’s-Grand-Slam-Lifts-Cardinals-Over-Nationals-13-8" class="headerlink" title="Flaherty’s Grand Slam Lifts Cardinals Over Nationals 13-8"></a>Flaherty’s Grand Slam Lifts Cardinals Over Nationals 13-8</h1><p>The St. Louis Cardinals continue their hot streak with a 13-8 victory over the Washington Nationals. The offensive firepower was led by outfielder Dexter Fowler and first baseman Matt Adams, who both had three hits apiece. But the star of the night was reliever Ryan Flaherty, who hit a grand slam in the bottom of the eighth inning to give the Cardinals the lead for good.</p>
<p>It was a back-and-forth game for most of the evening, with both teams trading blows. In the top of the fourth inning, Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon got things started with a solo home run off starter Luke Weaver. The Cardinals answered back in the bottom half of the inning when Adams doubled in two runs to make it 2-1 St. Louis.</p>
<p>Washington retook the lead in the fifth inning on a two-run homer by catcher Jose Lobaton. The Cardinals again responded in their half of the inning, this time with a three-run homer by Fowler to make it 5-3 St. Louis.</p>
<p>The Nationals tied it up at 5-5 in the sixth on a solo homer by second baseman Daniel Murphy, but St. Louis regained the lead in the bottom of that inning on an RBI single by shortstop Paul DeJong. That would be all the scoring until Flaherty’s heroics in the eighth inning.</p>
<p>With one out and runners on first and second base, Flaherty blasted a grand slam off Nationals reliever Brandon Kintzler to give his team a 9-5 lead. It was his first career grand slam, and it proved to be decisive as St. Louis went on to win by five runs.</p>
<p>Flaherty’s heroics gave Weaver his sixth win of the season, while reliever Dominic Leone picked up his first save of 2018. With this win, the Cardinals improve to 26-17 and remain percentage points ahead of Milwaukee for first place in the NL Central Division.</p>
